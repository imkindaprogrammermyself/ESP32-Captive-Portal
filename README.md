# ESP32-Captive-Portal
Converts the ESP32 into a captive portal. It uses [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP) library to serve the files and `DNSServer` to redirect all requests. In order for the captive portal to work on some devices, I have to use non local IP address like 172.x.x.x for `WiFi.softAPConfig();`

The captive portal webpage is flashed using this [tool](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/) but Platformio already included this tool see [this](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#uploading-files-to-file-system-spiffs). The files are accessed and served using `SPIFFS` via `request->send(SPIFFS, "/index.html", "text/html");`. I kept the flash usage under 1.5MB but yours may vary. I you changed your partition sizes, re-upload the files again.
